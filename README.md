This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This project is to gain experience using React Hooks for both State Management and for Firebase operations as
event listeners. It is also to gain more experience and understanding in the use of React Hooks in general so
that they can be properly utilized in future projects (such as KeepingCents).
